# LLM Orchestration Development Plan for Shopify Insights MCP Client

## Current Understanding

You're building a Shopify Insights application that needs to orchestrate LLM interactions with MCP servers. Your current implementation uses Chainlit for the UI, but the prompt engineering and orchestration logic needs improvement. You need a scalable approach that works well with PostgreSQL tools initially, with room to add more tools in the future.

## Analysis of Existing MCP Client Approaches

Looking at the code snippets provided, I can see several different approaches to LLM orchestration:

### ChatMCP Approach
- Uses a template-based system prompt generator
- Separates tool definitions from user prompts
- Includes detailed guidelines for tool usage and reasoning
- Has artifact handling capabilities for complex content

### 5ire Approach
- Uses a store-based approach for managing prompts
- Supports variables in system and user messages
- Allows for prompt customization (temperature, max tokens)
- Maintains a database of prompts

### Cline Approach
- Focuses on tool execution and error handling
- Has sophisticated response formatting
- Includes file system integration
- Provides detailed feedback on tool usage errors

## Orchestration Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Orchestration Framework

1. **Prompt Engineering System** 
   - Create a flexible prompt template system similar to ChatMCP 
   - Design system prompts specifically for Shopify data analysis 
   - Include reasoning guidelines for complex data operations 
   - Support for PostgreSQL query construction and validation 

2. **Tool Integration Framework** 
   - Standardize tool definition format 
   - Create a registry for available tools 
   - Implement tool execution pipeline with proper error handling 
   - Add support for PostgreSQL-specific tools first 

3. **Conversation Management** 
   - Implement conversation history tracking 
   - Add token counting and context window management 
   - Create a system for handling multi-turn interactions 
   - Support for follow-up questions on data analysis 

### Phase 2: Shopify-Specific Enhancements

1. **Shopify Data Schema Integration**
   - Create schema-aware prompting for Shopify data
   - Add validation for Shopify-specific queries
   - Implement common Shopify data analysis patterns
   - Support for entity recognition (products, customers, orders)

2. **Analysis Templates**
   - Create pre-built analysis templates for common Shopify insights
   - Implement parameterized queries for standard reports
   - Add visualization suggestion capabilities
   - Support for trend analysis and anomaly detection

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Add query performance analysis
   - Implement query rewriting for better performance
   - Create caching mechanisms for repeated queries
   - Support for incremental data processing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. **Multi-Tool Orchestration**
   - Implement tool chaining for complex workflows
   - Add support for parallel tool execution
   - Create decision trees for tool selection
   - Support for fallback strategies

2. **Interactive Refinement**
   - Add support for query refinement based on results
   - Implement interactive data exploration
   - Create explanation capabilities for complex analyses
   - Support for "what-if" scenario modeling

3. **Result Presentation**
   - Implement structured output formatting
   - Add support for different visualization formats
   - Create summary generation for complex results
   - Support for exporting insights to different formats

## Implementation Approach

### Core Components

1. **PromptManager** 
   - Manages system and user prompts 
   - Handles template substitution 
   - Supports Shopify-specific prompt engineering 
   - Maintains prompt versioning

2. **ToolOrchestrator** 
   - Registers and manages available tools 
   - Handles tool selection and execution 
   - Manages tool errors and retries 
   - Supports tool chaining

3. **ConversationManager** 
   - Tracks conversation history 
   - Manages context window 
   - Handles multi-turn interactions 
   - Supports conversation state 

4. **ShopifySchemaManager** (Partially implemented)
   - Maintains Shopify data schema (Basic implementation in tool registry)
   - Validates SQL queries against schema
   - Suggests schema-aware completions
   - Handles schema evolution

5. **ResultProcessor**
   - Formats query results
   - Generates summaries and insights
   - Suggests visualizations
   - Handles error presentation

### Integration with Chainlit

1. **UI Integration** 
   - Progress indicators for long-running queries 
   - Interactive query refinement
   - Result visualization
   - Error handling and feedback 

2. **Session Management** 
   - Per-user state management 
   - Session persistence
   - Authentication integration
   - Rate limiting and quota management

## Specific Recommendations

Based on the code I've seen, here are some specific recommendations:

1. **Adopt ChatMCP's Prompt Structure** 
   - The template-based approach with placeholders is flexible and maintainable 
   - The detailed guidelines improve LLM performance on complex tasks 
   - The separation of tool definitions from user prompts is clean 

2. **Use Cline's Error Handling** 
   - Detailed error messages improve user experience 
   - Structured error handling helps with debugging 
   - The formatting helpers make responses consistent 

3. **Create a PostgreSQL-Specific Tool Set** 
   - Query validation and sanitization 
   - Schema-aware query building 
   - Result formatting and pagination
   - Query performance optimization

4. **Implement Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start with simple queries and build complexity
   - Provide explanations for complex operations
   - Offer suggestions for further analysis
   - Support for drilling down into results

## Next Steps

1. **Create the PromptManager** 
   - Define the base prompt templates 
   - Implement template substitution 
   - Add Shopify-specific guidelines 
   - Create test cases for different query types

2. **Implement the ToolOrchestrator** 
   - Define the tool registration interface 
   - Create the execution pipeline 
   - Implement error handling 
   - Add support for PostgreSQL tools 

3. **Develop the ShopifySchemaManager** (Partially implemented)
   - Define the schema representation
   - Implement query validation
   - Create schema-aware suggestions
   - Add support for common Shopify queries

Once these components are in place, we can integrate them with your existing Chainlit client and begin testing with real Shopify data.
